        <p>My name is Alethia Li. Alethia comes from the Greek word <a href="https://nomadwarmachine.co.uk/2022/05/28/aletheia/" target="_blank">aletheia</a>, which means truth. <span class="highlight"> It’s also the name of the Greek goddess of truth.</span> Fun things that come with this name: I haven’t met or heard of anyone with the same name as me. And people can surprise me with the pronunciation and spelling. Whenever I order food there’s a moment of hesitation before I say my name as clearly as possible. It’s always nice when they get it right. </p>

        <h3>You are what you love</h3>
        <img src="images/musicaltheatre.jpg">
        <p>My list of hobbies has grown throughout the years, but usually the first thing I think of is reading. I love reading books and the power that words can have, and the art of storytelling. I also dabble in storytelling myself, writing when I can. Finally, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_theatre" target="_blank">musical theatre</a> brings everything else together— my hobbies of singing, playing piano and dancing. Acting is a new one, but I do love it. Also I do like to draw. You might be able to tell, <span class="highlight">I am a very arts oriented person.</span></p>

        <h3>My future</h3>
        <img src="images/future.jpg">
        <p>Being a junior in high school, it has become a bigger thing in my life to know what I want to do in the future. When I was in elementary school I had a dream of being a professional ballet dancer. Then I thought maybe I would be an artist? An <a href="https://thegreatestbooks.org/authors" target="_blank">author</a>? In high school now it’s less easy to throw around ideas. There’s always the fear that there isn’t a way to make a living with a degree in whatever. But <span class="bold">maybe I should just go for what I want</span>?</p>
